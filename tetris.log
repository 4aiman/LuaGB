==========

137760 - First VBlank busy loop after zeroing out DFFF and initializing a lot of IO ports.
137780 - Disable the display (!)
144088 - Finish zeroing out DF00-DFFF
242608 - Finish zeroing out
[before this] - zero out all of memory
448752 - start initializing high RAM from cart at 0x2AC7
494272 - Finish writing 0x2F to all of BG 0x9800 (??? Why?)
494636 - Return from a routine doing fancy things to sound registers
494736 - We've just re-enabled the display (At this point, the hardware should re-start at scanline 0?)

496328 - After comparing FFE3 with a lot of potential values (VBlank Interrupt)
496412 - Tetris starts a DMA transfer to OAM (not implemented!!)

497320 - Return from first VBlank routine (which didn't accomplish much)
497360 - Starts initializing Timer register values
497452 - Starts reading (very, very wrong!) joypad input

497852 - CB 87
560188 - Return from VBlank during disabled display (oops? Not sure how this is supposed to work tbh)

560356 - Roughly, this is a copy routine from cart RAM into VRAM, performing decompression from 1bpp to 2bpp
770696 - Tetris returns from its tile loading routines. (Check out those tiles!)
